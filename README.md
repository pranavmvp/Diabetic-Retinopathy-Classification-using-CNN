Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. It is estimated to affect over 93 million people.
Manual identification of the condition requires a trained physician to examine and evaluate images of the eye and submit their reviews, which may take a long time.

Classification of DR involves feeding fundus images of the eye into Convolution Neural Networks to identify anomalies such as presence of lesions, vascular abnormalities, etc.
